DQN
====
A Tensorflow DQN implementation based on [DeepMind's DQN](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-data/assets/papers/DeepMindNature14236Paper.pdf) for playing Atari games.


## Requirements
- [gym](https://gym.openai.com)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)

## Usage
To run, `python atari.py --game <env_name>`. It will run `SpaceInvaders-v0` by default.
Set `--display True` flag to see the game while training. 

## Issues
- Game display freezes after a few iteration of the trainig. (most likely a memory issue)
- Training takes too long.
